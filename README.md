> CC0 licensed assets for promoting anarchist events, programs, etc.

creating promotional materials for anarchist, communist, antifa, or related
events can be time-consuming and difficult due to limited resources. this
repo intends to serve as a home for CC0 licensed assets that can be used
to build these materials.

if you'd like to add an asset to this repo, please open a PR! if you would
like to request an asset that is not present in this repo, please open an
issue.
